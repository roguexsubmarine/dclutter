    file command (file *)

common file types (in description) -with priority (to avoid collision)
key descriptors !
    - directory (keep them in same directory)
    - compressed (all zips / tars / etc)
    - image (jpg / jpeg / png / svg)
    - text / ASCII  (all code goes here)
    - document (pdf / epub)
    
    - bin / src (all sorts of binaries and tar files)
    - audio (for mp4)
    - media (for video and rest - should come before iso images)
    - iso (ISO / boot)
    - microsoft (for that shit)

options:
    -i
        - will only consider images
        - to be used in directory of images
        - separate directories for jpg(/jpeg)/png/svg/tiff/raw
    
    -r [/days]
        - segregates into 2 directories one which is X days old and other
        - default 1 day

    -u 
        - Undo last categorization operation
        - if something goes wrong or unwanted
        - create and log the information in LOG_FILE (operation old_path new_path) and reverse them in UNDO operation

    -c
        - clean empty directories

    -h
        - to display options on top
        - display help and usage information
        
    -d
        - dump (revese the declutter)
        - check if any directories and pour their contents in current directory (will need dfs for this one)
        - use ls -R for this (does exactly what is written above)

    -w
        - replace all whitespace with (_) underscore in file names
    
    -x 
        - clear the log


   
to_dos : 
    - recent folder 
        - to have recent (downloads) (eg. last hour)
        - if clear the item if it is older than that
        - we need to make this one first (and copy the items)
        - cuz later other items will be moved to their categories


learnings
    - file --extension <file>   :   spits out extensions for most
    - file -b <file>            :   keeps is brief (without name prefix)



anamaloies
    - .html
        -two descriptors (HTML document and ASCII text) 
        - we wish to categorize in text (so ASCII)

    - .mkv
        - matroska data

    - .mp4
        - identified as ISO filetype
